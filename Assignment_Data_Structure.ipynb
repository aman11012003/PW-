The keys must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, or tuples), while values can be of any data type. In case of hash collisions, Python handles them using techniques like open addressing or chaining. Starting with Python 3.7, dictionaries preserve the insertion order of keys. Values can include nested data structures like lists or other dictionaries. Their flexibility and efficiency make them ideal for fast data mapping and retrieval tasks."

        "1. **Fast Lookups**:  \n",
        "  Dictionaries have O(1) average time complexity for key-based lookups due to their hash table implementation. In contrast, lists require O(n) time to find a value because each element must be verified sequentially.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Average Case**:  \n",
        "   - The average time complexity for accessing an element by its key is **O(1)**.  \n",
        "   - This efficiency comes from hashing, where the key is hashed to compute its position in the hash table, allowing direct access.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Worst Case**:  \n",
        "   - In rare cases of hash collisions (where multiple keys hash to the same position), the time complexity becomes **O(n)**.  \n",
        "   - Collisions are managed through techniques like chaining (linked lists) or open addressing, but excessive collisions in a poorly distributed hash table can degrade performance.\n",
        "\n",

        "1. **Sequential Data**:\n",
        "   - Lists are ideal when the data represents a sequence where order matters.\n",
        "   - Example: Storing a series of numbers `[10, 20, 30]` or processing items in a specific order.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Index-Based Access**:\n",
        "   - Use lists when you need to access elements by their position (index).\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **When Keys Are Unnecessary**:\n",
        "   - Lists are simpler when there's no need for labeled data or key-value pairs.\n",
        "   - Example: A collection of colors: `[\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Memory Efficiency**:\n",
        "   - Lists are generally more memory-efficient than dictionaries for small datasets, as dictionaries require additional storage for keys and hash tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Iterative Operations**:\n",
        "   - Lists are better suited for operations that require iterating over all items in order, such as sorting, filtering, or mapping.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries in Python are traditionally considered unordered because:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python dictionaries are typically seen as unordered due to the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hash-Based Storage**: Keys in dictionaries are stored based on their hash values, not their insertion order. This means the physical order in memory doesn’t correspond to the order in which items are added.\n",
        "2. **Efficiency Focus**: Dictionaries prioritize fast access and retrieval using hashing, rather than maintaining order.\n",
        "\n",
        "Though this behavior shouldn't be relied upon for hash table attributes, dictionaries maintain the **insertion order** as an implementation detail starting with **Python 3.7**, making them ordered in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Does This Affect Data Retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Key-Based Retrieval**:  \n",
        "   Since data retrieval is key-based, the physical order of storage doesn’t matter for access.  \n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\n",
        "   print(my_dict[\"b\"])  # Output: 2\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iteration**:  \n",
        "   Before Python 3.7, iterating over a dictionary could yield items in arbitrary order. After Python 3.7, the order of insertion is maintained.  \n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\n",
        "   for key in my_dict:\n",
        "       print(key)  # Outputs: a, b, c (in insertion order for Python 3.7+)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **No Positional Access**:  \n",
        "   Unlike lists, dictionaries cannot retrieve items by position (e.g., \"the third item\"). This limitation stems from their key-based design.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practical Impact:\n",
        "Prior to Python 3.7, dictionaries were unordered, which assured performance but required key lookups rather than positional actions. With the introduction of ordered dictionaries, users can now rely on predictable iteration, which improves readability and usefulness while maintaining speed."

        "\n",
        "3. **Key vs. Index**:\n",
        "   - **List**: Indexes are implicit and sequential (0, 1, 2, ...).\n",
        "   - **Dictionary**: Keys are explicitly defined and can be non-numeric (e.g., strings or tuples).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Order of Data**:\n",
        "   - **List**: Maintains the order of elements as they were added.\n",
        "   - **Dictionary**: Since Python 3.7, dictionaries also maintain insertion order, but retrieval is still key-based.\n",
        "\n",
